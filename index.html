        </header>

        <section class="about-text">
          <p>
            I am pursuing a master's degree in computer science at Northeastern University. 
            I am passionate about web development, database management and mobile development, 
            and I enjoy learning new technologies and frameworks.
          </p>

          <p>
            Before I decided to pursue further studies in Computer Science, I worked in the banking industry. 
            During my previous career, I developed a passion and curiosity for understanding customer behavior. 
            This led me to write a simple script to automate the process of selecting financial products for my customers. 
            This script not only saved me time at work but also sparked my realization of how appealing technology is to me. 
            It was this experience that ignited my passion for studying Computer Science. 
            I am excited to learn more techniques and apply my knowledge to develop software and tools that benefit people and simplify life.
          </p>

          <p>
            As a software development engineer co-op at Amazon Robotics, I improved our fulfillment product for customers, 
            focusing on developing new features and optimizing user experience. 
            I led the development of two transformative tools that enhance operator insights into the real-time status and navigation of Proteus, 
            Amazon's advanced autonomous robot. My role included engineering a robot path data service using Java and Gradle, 
            integrating DynamoDB and S3 for data management, and constructing service infrastructure with CDK. 
            In collaboration with UX designers, I designed and implemented a React and TypeScript front-end that displays live robot tasks and paths, 
            bolstered by a performant Redux store. 
            Additionally, I developed an internal tool with advanced authentication to streamline map metadata management, 
            significantly improving database interaction efficiency.

                  <p class="blog-text">
                    Hawaii is such a beautiful place that you should visit it at least once in your life.
                    During this trip, my journey took me to Oahu Island.

                    <p><strong>Hotel: Hyatt Regency Waikiki Beach, Room: Ocean front</strong></p>
                    <p>We have a beautiful view of the entire ocean without any obstructions, and I love the weather here. 
                       The ocean looks like a painting in front of me; the colors are bright and clean.

                    <p><strong>Diamond Head (Hiking)</strong></p>

                    <p>"Diamond Head is a volcanic tuff cone on the Hawaiian island of Oʻahu and known to Hawaiians as Lēʻahi. 
                        The Hawaiian name is most likely derived from lae plus ʻahi because the shape of the ridgeline resembles 
                        the shape of a tuna's dorsal fin." (Wikipedia)</p>
                    <img src="./images/hawaii/Day1/73F58F6D-724F-42ED-9ADF-25083C212CF4.jpeg" alt="Diamond Head">

                    <p> I had a great time hiking up Diamond Head. From the observation deck at the mountain's summit, you can overlook the entirety of Waikiki Beach. 
                        Many tourists choose to wait here for the sunset, which casts a stunning glow on the beach, creating a breathtakingly 
                        beautiful scene. It's worth noting that as sunset approaches, it tends to get windy and a bit chilly on the mountain, 
                        so remember to bring a light jacket.

                    <p><strong>Hanauma Bay (Snorkeling)</strong></p>

                    <p>"Hanauma is a marine embayment formed within a tuff ring and located along the southeast coast of the Island of Oʻahu in the Hawaii Kai neighborhood of 
                        East Honolulu, in the Hawaiian Islands. Hanauma is one of the most popular tourist destinations on the Island and has suffered somewhat from overtourism." (Wikipedia)</p>

                    <p>This was my first time snorkeling. The weather was perfect, and we saw many beautiful, colorful fish near the reef, including a few honus (Hawaiian Green sea turtles). 
                       If you plan to go diving in Hawaii, always wear sunscreen, even on cloudy days. Otherwise, you might end up sunburned like I did (lesson learned).

                    <p>By the way, I have a quirky joke for you: How can you prove in one sentence that you've been to Hawaii?</p>
                    <p>There's a unique reef triggerfish found in Hawaii, known as Humuhumu-nukunuku-āpuaʻa, which is the state fish of Hawaii.</p>
                    <p>A memorable name isn't it? Below is what it looks like (bottom left).</p>

                    <p><strong>Kualoa Ranch (UTV tour)</strong></p>
                    <img src="./images/hawaii/Day2/D8F536E9-D025-494A-AB9B-FED92BD69715.jpeg" alt="Kualoa Ranch">
                    <p>I participated in a two-hour tour at Kualoa Ranch, where we drove off-road vehicles following a designated route. The ranch is 
                        expansive and has been a filming location for many famous movies, the most notable being Jurassic World. It boasts lush greenery and towering trees. </p>
                    <img src="./images/hawaii/Day2/011B2176-CC70-43F4-8FD6-A7E7853381EE.jpeg" alt="Kualoa Ranch">

                    <p>During the tour, I had the chance to taste the locally unique strawberry guava. Although only the size of a strawberry, it was incredibly sweet and delicious. 
                        Unfortunately, this variety of guava is not available in other parts of the United States, and it cannot be taken out of Hawaii.</p>
                    <img src="./images/hawaii/Day2/46763B88-1A6C-42BB-8BFC-FB543F8B2993.jpeg" alt="Kualoa Ranch">

                    <p>For those planning to take the off-road vehicle tour, I recommend wearing clothes that you don't mind getting dusty, as the trails can be quite dusty.</p><br>

                    <p><strong>Polynesian Cultural Center</strong></p>
                    <img src="./images/hawaii/Food/BF98E337-B8C1-4BD5-AE2B-3140CB908F9C.jpeg" alt="Polynesian Cultural Center">

                    <p>The Polynesian Cultural Center in Hawaii is a truly worthwhile destination for those seeking to understand Hawaiian culture. Hawaii is primarily composed of six distinct islands, 
                        each with its own unique characteristics and culture. The Cultural Center offers an abundance of performances, allowing visitors to experience Hawaiian traditions in an immersive and direct way. 
                        The performances were so captivating that I kept forgetting to take photos. The lunch provided was delicious, especially the roast pig and grilled fish.</p>
                    <img src="./images/hawaii/Day2/D3291BDC-37BA-40A1-AE02-7162A482A255.jpeg" alt="Polynesian Cultural Center">
                    <p>Finally, I highly recommend attending the evening show titled 'HĀ: Breath of Life.' Photography is not permitted during the performance, so I cannot provide any pictures. This show brilliantly 
                        encapsulates the cultural essence and features of Hawaii's six islands with traditional costumes and dances that are truly awe-inspiring. Most of the performers are students from the University 
                        of Hawaii. The host candidly informed us that by attending the show, we were supporting their education and expressed gratitude for our visit to Hawaii. 
                        So, come on, visit Hawaii and experience its rich culture firsthand.</p><br>

                    <p>There are many beautiful places in Hawaii that I didn't have time to visit on this trip. Especially considering I only explored Oahu this time around. I'm eagerly looking forward to my next encounter with Hawaii.</p>

                    <p>"Loco moco is a dish featured in contemporary Hawaiian cuisine. There are many variations, but the traditional loco moco consists of white rice, topped with a hamburger, a fried egg, and brown gravy." (Wikipedia)</p>
                    <p>On this trip, I tried the loco moco at Aloha Table restaurant, reputed to be the best in Hawaii. It was indeed incredibly fragrant and delicious. The fried onions sprinkled on top and within the gravy were a perfect 
                        complement to the meat sauce and patty. Moreover, the patty seemed to be made of Wagyu beef, which was exceptionally juicy and bursting with the rich aromas of meat and butter.</p><br>
                    <img src="./images/hawaii/Food/F83A5E7A-30CF-4BC7-8087-6CA1B0962EF4.jpeg" alt="food">
                    <p>The Waiahole Poi Factory is a quaint local eatery near the Kualoa Ranch. It's quite small and unassuming, and it doesn't even qualify as a restaurant since there's no indoor dining. However, this modest establishment 
                        offers some of the area's most renowned and delicious dishes. We tried the Laulau and Sweet Lady of Waiahole.</p>
                    <p>Laulau is pork wrapped in the leaves of a native Hawaiian plant and baked until the meat's savory flavor 
                        melds with the herbal fragrance of the leaves, resulting in a tender and juicy delicacy.</p>
                    <p>Sweet Lady of Waiahole is a dessert featuring taro (poi) ice cream paired with a taro-flavored sticky rice. The coolness of 
                        the ice cream contrasts beautifully with the warmth of the sticky rice, creating a delightful hot-and-cold sensation in your mouth. The taro used in the ice cream is a Hawaiian specialty known as poi, distinguished 
                        by a unique flavor that is distinctly different and sweeter than other varieties of taro.</p><br>
                    <img src="./images/hawaii/Food/D230900B-D232-4A68-9E7C-1629DDAD74F5.jpeg" alt="food">
                    <p>On Oahu Island, there are many Japanese restaurants that serve tonkatsu (fried pork cutlet). After careful selection, we tried a place called Tonkatsu Tamafuji. Here, customers have the unique opportunity to grind 
                        sesame seeds in a bowl using a pestle, turning them into a coarse powder and fully releasing their aroma. Then, tonkatsu sauce is added to the sesame mixture, enhancing each bite of the pork cutlet with a captivating 
                        and delicious flavor. The quality of the tonkatsu itself is also exceptional. The thin, crispy crust becomes even crunchier after being deep-fried, while the juices of the pork are sealed within. </p>
                    <p>Every bite I took here was a delight, and I highly recommend this restaurant to all tonkatsu enthusiasts. </p>
                    <img src="./images/hawaii/Food/2D0BD39D-ABE7-49C6-8339-405C537BE959.jpeg" alt="food">
                    <p>Giovanni's is a renowned local food truck, representing Hawaii's vibrant food truck culture. Like many tourists, I made it a point to visit. However, I must honestly say that apart from the deliciously flavored garlic shrimp, 
                        there wasn't anything particularly exceptional.</p>
                    <img src="./images/hawaii/Food/ABB3E1EF-F0AA-49BA-8CD4-0B1A7B2AED4B.jpeg" alt="food">
                    <p>Due to Hawaii's proximity to Japan, Japanese cuisine has become an integral part of the Hawaiian culinary scene. We tried a Japanese yakitori restaurant called Tori Ton. Overall, it was quite delicious, though not markedly 
                        different from other yakitori places I've experienced elsewhere. If you're looking for a reliable yakitori restaurant, I would recommend this one.</p>
                    <img src="./images/hawaii/Food/7BEFEA5E-AD7F-4C7D-84D3-BF894B5F3EC8.jpeg" alt="food">
                    <p>There are many places to enjoy a poke bowl in Hawaii. After trying numerous spots, we realized there isn't much of a noticeable difference between them. Perhaps it's because Hawaii is surrounded by the sea, ensuring that all 
                        establishments have equally fresh ingredients. Additionally, poke seasoning is typically light, so the taste doesn't vary much from place to place. Anyway, you can't go wrong with any poke bowl on the island, and I don't have 
                        any specific recommendations.</p>
                    <img src="./images/hawaii/Food/B67FA6BF-0788-4AAF-93E6-2CDEAD9EC8B3.jpeg" alt="food">
                    <p>On the island of Oahu, there's a coffee shop you absolutely must not miss - Island Vintage Coffee. </p>
                    <p>Not only is their brunch exceptionally good and delicious, but their coffee is also worth trying. </p>
                    <p>The Island Latte and Hawaiian Honey Latte, in particular, let you fully savor the unique taste of Hawaiian coffee. Hawaiian coffee beans have a very special aroma, which I find hard to describe due to the limitations of my 
                        language - it's just incredibly fragrant and delicious. When I left Hawaii, I even bought several packs of whole coffee beans from the shop to grind and brew at home with my coffee machine. I really love Hawaiian coffee.</p>
                    <p>By the way, if you are going to Island Vintage Coffee at Waikiki Beach, you should definitely try the Island Vintage Shave Ice, which is located right in front of Island Vintage Coffee. Their ice cream has a rich and creamy
                        milk flavor that's absolutely delicious.</p>
